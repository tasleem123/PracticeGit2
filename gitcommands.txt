Git Branching
Branches in git are nothing but pointers to a specific commit
There are 2 types of branches
1. Local branch - It is just another path or your working tree. 
2. Remote tracking branches - They have special purposes for linking
your work from the local repository to the work on central repository,
The automatically detect which remote branches to get changes from,
who you use the command git pull

git branch <branchname> - It will create the branchname
git checkout branchname - It will change the head pointer to test
branch

git merge <branchname> - It will merge other branch with the master
branch
